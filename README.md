DESCRIPTION
This program generates an endless 2d landscape emulating the appearance of a jigsaw puzzle.  Tiles can be clicked, creating a black dot that stays on the same time persistently, even if the user has scrolled away.  This program also implements autotiling.  There are 2 small circles on each border of each tile, of the color of the adjacent tile.  This is to emulate the appearance of tabs on a puzzle piece.

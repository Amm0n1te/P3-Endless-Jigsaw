DESCRIPTION
This program generates an endless 2d landscape emulating the appearance of a jigsaw puzzle.  Tiles can be clicked, creating a black dot that stays on the same tile persistently, even if the user has scrolled away.  This program also implements autotiling.  There are small circles on each border of each tile, to simulate the tabs of a jigsaw puzzle piece.

ARTIST STATEMENT
My artistic vision for this project continually iterated throughout the development of this project.  In the beginning, I wasn't sure what I could do, and was focused on first understanding the code to get a feel for what was feasable for me.  I ended up iterating to a jigsaw puzzle aesthetic, with a color palette that (I think) evokes a feeling of like 70s abstract art, especially with the off-white.  This project was much more difficult than p1 and p2 for me, and the majority of my time was spent deciphering the code.  This took about 2 days.  It was very difficult to understand how it draws tiles to simulate scrolling, and I still feel that I don't understand it fully.  After that, it didn't take long to iterate to the jigsaw puzzle aesthetic.  It was relatively simple to implement, and I think it still looks pretty good.
